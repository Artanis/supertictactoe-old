                <ul>
                    <li><p>The game board is nine Tic-Tac-Toe boards placed in a larger Tic-Tac-Toe board.</p></li>
                    <li><p>The first move may be played anywhere.</p>
                        <p>Each move after the first is played in the Tic-Tac-Toe board corresponding to the square the previous move played in.</p>
                        <p>For example, if Player 1 plays in the top middle board on the bottom left square, then Player 2 must play in the bottom left board.</p>
                        <p>If the indicated board is full, then that move may be played anywhere.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Getting three in a row in any board claims the square on the large Tic-Tac-Toe board for the winner</p>
                        <p>Moves can be made in that board even after it is won, until it is full.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Getting three in a row on the large Tic-Tac-Toe board wins the game for that player</p>
                        <p>Known Bug: The game does not end when a player wins, and play may continue until the all squares are full, resulting in a reported Cats Game.</p></li>

                    <p>You can load a game by choosing Load Game from the Game Menu and choosing a saved game. Depending on the state of the game, it will either be loaded for continued play or as a replay. Currently, An in-progress game will load instantly, but a completed game will enter replay mode.</p>
